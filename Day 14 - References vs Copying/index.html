    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    const team5 = Array.from(team4)
    team5[0] = 'Trevor'
    console.log(team4, team5)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Parker Klein',
      age: 23
    }

    // and think we make a copy:
    //const captain = person
    //captain.number = 99
    //console.log(person, captain)

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 3 })
    console.log(person, captain)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap2 = {...person}
    // cap2.age = 24
    // console.log(person, cap2)

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
